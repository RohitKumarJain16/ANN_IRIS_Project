# ANN Iris Classification Project

A simple, well-documented implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the classic Iris dataset. This repository contains code to train, evaluate, and visualize a feed-forward neural network for multiclass classification of Iris flower species.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a small artificial neural network from scratch (or using a framework included in the repo) to classify the three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It is intended as an educational example that includes data preparation, model implementation, training loop, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## Features

- Clean, easy-to-follow implementation of an ANN for multiclass classification
- Train / validation split and reproducible training with fixed random seeds
- Model saving and loading utilities
- Basic visualizations for accuracy and loss over time
- Confusion matrix and classification report generation

## Dataset

The project uses the Iris dataset — a small, widely used dataset in pattern recognition. The dataset has 150 samples, 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width), and 3 classes.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository or scikit-learn's built-in dataset loader.

## Model

The repository implements a feed-forward neural network (multilayer perceptron) for multiclass classification. Typical configuration used in this project:

- Input layer: 4 features
- Hidden layers: configurable (e.g., 1–2 layers with ReLU activation)
- Output layer: 3 units with softmax activation
- Loss: Cross-entropy (categorical)
- Optimizer: configurable (e.g., SGD, Adam)

If your code uses a framework such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, or NumPy-only implementation, consult the relevant scripts for exact architecture and hyperparameters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/RohitKumarJain16/ANN_IRIS_Project.git
   cd ANN_IRIS_Project

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

If there is no requirements.txt, common dependencies include:

   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn torch tensorflow

Adjust based on the implementation in this repository.

## Usage

- To train a new model:

  python train.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 16 --lr 0.01

- To evaluate a saved model:

  python evaluate.py --model-path checkpoints/model.pt

- To run inference on a custom sample, check examples/infer_example.py or run the inference script provided.

Replace script names with those available in the repository.

## Training

- Use a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility.
- Monitor training and validation loss/accuracy; tune hyperparameters if necessary.
- Save checkpoints regularly to avoid losing progress.

## Evaluation

- The project reports standard classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualize results using matplotlib/seaborn to better understand model behavior.

## Results

Expected results on the Iris dataset (vary with model and training hyperparameters):

- Accuracy: typically > 0.9 for a properly configured MLP
- Confusion matrix and per-class metrics included in evaluation scripts

Include an example output or a screenshot of training curves or confusion matrix if available in the repository.
